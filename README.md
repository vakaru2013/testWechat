# testWechat
This project tests Wechat programming, it is a web server app, but the client is typically not a browser but the Wechat app which runs on iOS or Android.

the server app is implemented with Python and is hosted on BAE(Baidu App Engine), and the Wechat Public Account is "家乡味道", you can tests this project once you have followed this account in Wechat.

For now, I plan to implement some simple SNS features:
1, you can find other people online,
2, you can send email to people you like,
3, you can check your own inbox to see if there is any person who is interested with you.
